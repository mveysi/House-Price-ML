# Project Purpose

Our aim in this project is to create a model that will predict house prices. By comparing all models, we will use the model with the leaast error score. CatBoost appears to be the model with the best accuracy rate.
In addition CatBoost rmse score was 25465.4868 before hyper optimization. After the hyper optimization rmse score is being 0.12269452020805767.
